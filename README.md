EcoSync: Green Energy Solutions Marketplace

EcoSync is a web-based marketplace designed to connect green energy companies with consumers in Malaysia. This project addresses the challenges of low visibility for green energy providers and the lack of accessible, reliable information for consumers, aiming to accelerate the adoption of sustainable energy in the country. 


The platform addresses key problems in Malaysia's green energy sector:

Lack of Visibility: Green energy companies often struggle to reach potential customers. 
Lack of Information: Consumers lack a centralized resource to compare green energy solutions. 
Credibility Issues: It can be difficult for consumers to assess the quality and reliability of services offered by different companies. 


Key Features:

Company & Consumer Profiles: Allows companies to showcase their services and consumers to manage their information. 
Solar Panel Estimation Tool: An innovative feature that allows users to draw on a map of their roof to estimate potential savings and the required system size. 
Quotation & Project Management: A streamlined module for requesting, managing, and tracking service quotations and project timelines. 
Secure Payments: Integrated with Stripe Connect for secure and reliable transactions. 
Real-time Communication: A messaging system for direct communication between consumers and companies. 
Admin Moderation & Incentives: Includes admin tools for platform management and a dedicated module for users to explore green energy incentives. 


The development of this platform followed a waterfall methodology, with comprehensive phases for requirement gathering, design, implementation, and testing. The reason that I chose waterfall is due to the timeline of this Final Year Project and also a solo project. 

The project was built using the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
